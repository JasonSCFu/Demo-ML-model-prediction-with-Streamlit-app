You can click this [link](https://jasonscfu-demo-ml-model-prediction-with-streamlit-testml-dzr840.streamlit.app/) to visualize the app.


### Installation
- pip install streamlit
- pip install scikit-learn
- pip install matplotlib



### Step to create this streamlit interface
1. Use Logistic Regression- Employee Analytics-Streamlit.ipynb to create and save the model. The model is saved as emp-model.pkl. We built a toy model for demo purpose, the focus is not on modelling part.
2. Create a streamlit interface to interact with our pickle file.
3. Get model results from the streamlit interface.
4. Run streamlit run main.py in terminal to deploy the streamlit app.
